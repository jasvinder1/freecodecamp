# Celestial Bodies Database

This is one of the required projects to earn the Relational Databases certification. For this project, I built a database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL. If the term "celestial bodies" is unfamiliar to you, it refers to the planets, stars, moons, and other natural things found in space. 

In this repository, you'll find a notebook which explains how I prepare the data, the SQL queries, and the database file itself. Every piece of information in the tables that I built has been gathered from the internet, so any corrections to the information provided here are greatly appreciated.
